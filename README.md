Database is made in config.js. As the user can't edit data, this was the simplist way to store the data for now

## To Run Website
Need to download packages (npm install _____) that are needed. These are located at top of app.js, and include but aren't limited to 'express'.
After these are installed, setup database so there is a database server open on port 8010 (or if other port, update port in both JS files) and update password/login info on both app.js and config.js. From there run app.js and go to localhost:3000 on a browser. This takes you to the home screen.
